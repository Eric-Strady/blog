Project 3: Blog for the writer Jean Forteroche

This is a project for Openclassrooms as part of the Multimedia Project Manager course.
This blog need to be build with PHP and MVC architecture. Moreover it has to be build without framework (like Symphony) and developped with a minimum of OOP for Model's part.

->index.php:
	-->instantiate Router

Folder:
->controller:
